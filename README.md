# Status
Currently I implemented the base functionalities without an orchestrator agent. I have a menu to do the orchestration part. I will use it like this for couple of months to debug and understand how the orchestration should work. Then I will implement the orchestration agent to top of these modules/agents.

The reason I am not doing dummy test is I want to see if it is really useful on real-life scenarios like mine. And also to provide time for testing and debugging.
